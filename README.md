# Hype-Worker

This Application is a part of my project "HYPE", this application came into a picture after the client agrees to do advertisement using this 
application [Hype-Client](https://github.com/sidpatel-github/Hype-Client). Here worker will get a notification about it's work likewise if 
its physical hoarding then to put the appropriate hoarding to a specific place or if the hoarding is digital then it may need to change in 
short a worker will get notification according to the type of advertisements.

The map will be shown in the application so that a worker can know the location properly. Chatting is also included so that worker can interact 
directly with the agency and after completion of work worker will send a photograph of the hoarding to the agency as an acknowledgment.
